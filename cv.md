> ## info

I entered to the RS School because I like programming.  
In my school time I got carried away by the Basic programming language.  
When I studied HTML and CSS I realized that I really like to write code.  
But I thought that it is too late for me to become programmer in my ages.  
Then I met one good person from EPAM and he said: "Please, stop afraid, just do it!" and I do.
